# CVE-2025-69752 - Insecure Direct Object Reference in Ideagen Q-Pulse QMS
> **Vendor:** Ideagen  
> **Product:** Q-Pulse QMS (Quality Management System) 
> **Version Tested:** 7.1.0.32  
> **Versions Affected:** 7.1.0.32 (other versions were not tested and may also be affected)  
> **Vulnerability Type:** CWE-284: Improper Access Control / CWE-639: Authorisation Bypass Through User-Controlled Key  
> **Patch Available:** Vendor unresponsive

---

## Description

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the "My Details" user profile functionality of Q-Pulse QMS. When an authenticated user navigates to their profile page, the application includes an `objectKey` parameter in the URL that directly references the user's internal identifier. The application does not perform any server-side authorization check to verify that the requesting user is permitted to access the profile associated with the given `objectKey` value.

As a result, a low-privilege authenticated user can modify the `objectKey` parameter to reference any valid user identifier and retrieve the profile information of other users in the system. The disclosed information includes the target user's full name, work email address, job title, and department.

This vulnerability was identified in Q-Pulse version 7.1.0.32 during an authorised penetration test. Other versions of Q-Pulse were not available for testing and may also be affected.

## Affected Component

The "My Details" user profile page within Q-Pulse. Specifically, the server-side handling of the `objectKey` HTTP parameter, which directly maps to a user identifier and is used to determine which profile to display.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Authenticate to the Q-Pulse application as a low-privilege user.
2. Navigate to the "My Details" page and observe the URL, noting the `objectKey` parameter value (e.g. `&objectKey=1`).
3. Modify the `objectKey` parameter to a different valid user identifier (e.g. `&objectKey=2`).
4. Submit the modified request. The application returns the profile details of the referenced user, including their full name, work email address, job title, and department.
5. The `objectKey` value can be incremented or enumerated to retrieve the profile information of all users in the system.

## Impact

An authenticated attacker can enumerate and access the profile information of every user registered in the Q-Pulse instance. The exposed data such as full names, work email addresses, job titles, and department information provides a detailed organisational directory that could be used to facilitate targeted phishing campaigns, social engineering attacks, or reconnaissance for further attacks against the organisation.

## Remediation

The following measures are recommended to address this vulnerability:

**Server-Side Authorisation:** Enforce access control checks on the server side to ensure that the authenticated user is only permitted to view their own profile via the "My Details" functionality. The `objectKey` parameter should be validated against the user's session to confirm ownership of the requested resource.

**Indirect Object References:** Replace predictable, sequential user identifiers in the `objectKey` parameter with non-guessable references such as UUIDs or tokenised values. This does not replace proper authorisation checks but adds an additional layer of defence by making enumeration impractical.

**Principle of Least Privilege:** Review the application's access control model to ensure that user profile data is only accessible to the profile owner and explicitly authorised roles (e.g. administrators).
